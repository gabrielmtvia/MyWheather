# MyWheather

AND1 project 4th semester (Gabriel Moutinho)
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
Brief description of the application and the motivation behind it:

MyWeather is a simple weather app with a functionality of retreiving real time data from an online API about the weather
in different locations and the possibility to store that information in a local database.

Prioritized requirements for the app (user stories)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1- As a user, I want to be able to search by location to see the current weather at that specific location.

2- As a user, I want to be able to store a search to be able to review that information later.

3- As a user, I want the weather information to be in real time when I search a location

4- As a user, I want the app to display an icon for the current weather, the city, temperature and the timestamp.

5- As a user, I want to store the saved searches in a local database so I don't lose information.
